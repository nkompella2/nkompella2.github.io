			 	however they want to. After organizing it into a data table, it also allows users to 
				filter their data and seperate it in differnt ways that make the data easier to interpret.
				This app also generates a bar graph and a volcano plot with the newly filtered data. It is 
				an easy and quick way for anyone to play with their data!
